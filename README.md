   java --version
   mvn --version
   ```

### Building the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd java-calculator
   ```

2. **Compile and Package**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   mvn package
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Generate Test Coverage Report**
   ```bash
   mvn jacoco:report
   # View report at: target/site/jacoco/index.html
   ```

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Maven (Development)
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

### Option 2: Using JAR File (Distribution)
```bash
java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar target/java-calculator-1.0.0.jar
```

### Option 3: Using Executable JAR (Self-contained)
```bash
java -jar target/java-calculator-1.0.0-shaded.jar
```

## Usage

### Mouse/Touch Input
- Click number buttons (0-9) to input digits
- Click operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) to set operations
- Click "=" to calculate results
- Click "AC" to clear all and reset
- Click "CE" to clear current entry only
- Click "←" to delete the last digit
- Click "." to add decimal points
- Click "±" to toggle positive/negative

### Keyboard Input
| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| 0-9 | Number input |
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| . | Decimal point |
| Enter or = | Calculate |
| Escape | All Clear (AC) |
| Delete | Clear Entry (CE) |
| Backspace | Delete last digit |

### Example Calculations

**Basic Arithmetic:**
```
5 + 3 = 8
10 - 4 = 6
7 × 3 = 21
15 ÷ 3 = 5
```

**Decimal Numbers:**
```
3.14 + 2.86 = 6
10.5 ÷ 2 = 5.25
```

**Negative Numbers:**
```
-5 + 3 = -2
10 - (-3) = 13
```

**Chained Operations:**
```
5 + 3 × 2 = 16  (calculated as (5 + 3) × 2)
```

## Error Handling

The calculator gracefully handles various error conditions:

- **Division by Zero**: Displays "Error: Division by zero"
- **Invalid Input**: Prevents invalid number formats
- **Overflow**: Handles very large numbers appropriately
- **Recovery**: Any new input clears error state and resumes normal operation

## Architecture

The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:

### Model (`CalculatorModel`)
- Handles all business logic and calculations
- Maintains calculator state (current value, operations, etc.)
- Performs arithmetic operations using `BigDecimal` for precision
- Manages error states and input validation

### View (`CalculatorView`)
- Creates and manages the user interface
- Handles layout and styling of components
- Processes keyboard input events
- Provides visual feedback to users

### Controller (`CalculatorController`)
- Coordinates between Model and View
- Handles user interactions (button clicks)
- Updates the display based on model state
- Manages event handlers and UI updates

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Maintain or improve test coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**JavaFX Module Issues:**
```bash
# If you see module-related errors, ensure JavaFX is properly configured
mvn javafx:run -Djavafx.args="--add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
```

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
mvn clean
mvn compile
```

**Test Failures:**
```bash
# Run tests in headless mode (for CI environments)
mvn test -Djava.awt.headless=true
```

### Performance Tips

- The calculator is optimized for numbers up to 15 digits
- For very large calculations, results may be displayed in scientific notation
- Memory usage is optimized and should not exceed 50MB during normal operation
